# Best All-around Rider Competition. Assigns points for each top-15 placing in major Disciplines: road, track, etc.
# Calculates a BAR for each Discipline, and an Overall BAR that combines all the discipline BARs.
# Also calculates a team BAR.
# Recalculating the BAR at years-end can take nearly 30 minutes even on a fast server. Recalculation must be manually triggered.
# This class implements a number of OBRA-specific rules and should be generalized and simplified.
# The BAR categories and disciplines are all configured in the database. Race categories need to have a bar_category_id to 
# show up in the BAR; disciplines must exist in the disciplines table and discipline_bar_categories.
