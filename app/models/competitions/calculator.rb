module Competitions
  # Stateless, functional-style competition calculations. No dependencies on database or Rails.
  # Given source results as an Array of Hashes, returns competition results as an Array of Hashes.
  # Responsible for result eligibility, points, placing and person or team identity.
  # Not responsible for display data like people's names or teams.
  #
  # Use participant_id instead of person_id or team_id. People and teams are treated the same in calculations.
  # "Participant" means "someone or some people who at least started a race and show up in the results"
  #
  # Non-scoring results from the same race need to be passed in for team size calculations.
  module Calculator
    # TODO Team size should be calculated before any filtering
    # FIXME Only calc team sizes if we care about team size

    # Use simple datatypes with no behavior. Hash doesn't have method-like accessors, which means we
    # can't use symbol to proc. E.g., results.sort_by(&:points). OpenStruct is slow. Full-blown classes 
    # are overkill. Could add methods to Struct using doâ€¦end, ActiveModels or maybe subclass Hash but Struct 
    # works well.
    #
    # Struct::Result would clash with Active Record models so Structs are prefixed with "Calculator."

    # Source result or calculated competition result.
    # +tied+ is plumbing set during calculation. If place method can't break a tie, results are marked as "tied" so they 
    # are given the same points.
    #
    # +team_size+ is calculated here, too, though it could be passed in.

    # * field_size_bonus: true/false. Default to false. Give 1.5 X points for fields of 75 or more
    # * multiple_results_per_race: true/false. Default to false. Is it OK for a participant to have multiple results for 
    #   the same event? Used by the Team BAR, as a team could have several results in the same race.
    # * point_schedule: 0-based Array of points for result place. Defaults to nil (all results receive one point). 
    #                    First place gets points at point_schedule[0].

    #   Used by OBRA Overall and Age-Graded BARs.
