module Competitions
  # Stateless, functional-style competition calculations. No dependencies on database or Rails.
  # Given source results as an Array of Hashes, returns competition results as an Array of Hashes.
  # Responsible for result eligibility, points, placing and person or team identity.
  # Not responsible for display data like people's names or teams.

    # Use simple datatypes with no behavior. Hash doesn't have method-like accessors, which means we
    # can't use symbol to proc. E.g., results.sort_by(&:points). OpenStruct is slow. Full-blown classes 
    # are overkill. Could add methods to Struct using doâ€¦end, ActiveModels or maybe subclass Hash but Struct 
    # works well.
    #
