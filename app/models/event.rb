# Superclass for anything that can have results:
# * Event (Superclass only used to organizes multiple sets of results on a single day.
#          Examples: Alpenrose Challenge Morning Session, Alpenrose Challenge Afternoon Session)
# * SingleDayEvent (Most events, an event on a particular date. Appears on calendar.)
# * MultiDayEvent (Spans more than one day. has many SingleDayEvent children)
# * Competition (Results are calculated/derived from other events' results. Examples: Combined TT times, OBRA BAR)
#
# instructional: class or clinc
# practice: training session
#
# Events have four similar, but distinct relationships to other Events:
# * parent-children: A one-to-many tree. Example: stage race parent + stages children.
#   Used for calculating competition results and schedule display. Does _not_ include
#   Competitions, even though Competitions can have Event parents.
#
#   A purer children association would return all child Events and Competitions
#  (that's how they are in the database). But we almost always want just the child Events,
#   and not the Competitions.
#   
# * parent-child_competitions: A one-to-many tree. Example: stage race MultiDayEvent parent
#   with GC and KOM child_competitions. Typically combined with children when we really
#   do want all child Competitions and Events.
#
# * competition_event_memberships: many-to-many from Events to Competitions. Example: Banana Belt I
#   can be a member of the Oregon Cup and the OBRA Road BAR. And the Oregon Cup also includes Kings Valley RR,
#   Table Rock RR, etc. CompetitionEventMembership is a meaningul class in its own right.
#
# Changes to parent Event's attributes are propogated to children, unless the children's attributes are already different.
# See propogated_attributes
# 
# It's debatable whether we need STI subclasses or not.
#
# All notification code just supports combined TT results, and should be moved to background processing
